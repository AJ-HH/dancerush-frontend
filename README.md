# Dancerush Frontend
Frontend for a website to view and search through a list of dancerush songs, utilises the dancerush song API (https://github.com/AJ-HH/dancerush)

# Background
It is currently difficulty to search for songs based on specific categories, such as difficulty, name, artist or more importantly whether a song is available by default or not. This would be useful for new players looking for a song they can already play that fits their difficulty level. There are currently 3 options for looking for songs:
- The official dancerush website (which doesn't have all the songs) https://p.eagate.573.jp/game/dan/1st/music/entrance.html
- Remywiki which has the songs available in an annoying to read table view (can't be searched easily) https://remywiki.com/AC_DRS
- The dancerush stardom discord server bot, which requires access to the server (not difficult but need to manually type in commands to the bot)
