# Known Issues

- Song modal does not work for certain mobile devices. This has no consistency, on my phone (iPhone) and a friend (iPhone) it doesn't show the song details, while other friends (iPhone + Android) on different browsers (Safari, Firefox) it shows all the details. If you have an iPhone 12 it will not work for some reason.
