# Dancerush Frontend
Frontend for a website to view and search through a list of dancerush songs, utilises the dancerush song API (https://github.com/AJ-HH/dancerush). Made with React and Material-UI, can be viewed here: https://dancerush-song-viewer-ee159.web.app/

# Known Issues

- Cannot go beyond 10 songs at a time - pagination will be done when I have the time 
- Song modal does not work for certain mobile devices. This has no consistency, on my phone (iPhone) and a friend (iPhone) it doesn't show the song details, while other friends (iPhone + Android) on different browsers (Safari, Firefox) it shows all the details
- May be difficult to close modals on very small screens
